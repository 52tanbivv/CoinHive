# Reasons for this script :
It is silent can use little to no cpu power and provides a clean ad free internet experience while allowing the sites you love to stay online.

Ads can be intrusive and annoying, Look at popups for example, flashing images, auto playing sounds etc.

Advertisers don't pay for VPN/Proxy connected or related traffic because they consider it BOT traffic without considering the fact it is only increasing as goverments and who ever you pay every month to supply you with internet access create blockades and blacklists forcing people to use such services to access sites. If someone connects and browses with a known flagged VPN/Proxy to them even if that user is displaying ads and can see them you earn nothing from advertising.

Advertisers can scam and won't pay a penny for the most outrageous of reasons.

Advertisers take a percentage before paying you.

Banks, Paypal all also take a percentage and charge fees on transactions of money earned leaving you with less and less hard earned money for your work.

# Same problems as advertisers have with adblockers :
People use their hosts files to blackhole and block domains they can do the same with this.
Your internet service provider also blocking domain access to this script, Soloution can be to login to your account online and turn off parental filters etc what ever it is listed under if they allow you to remove the blocks.

Anti-Viruses and external programs block mining but not popups or other ads that are far more intrusive. (I realy questioned why AV Software and Internet service providers block this script but not the companies taking over my browser with popup windoiws and opening as many tabs as they please.)

# Questionable behaviour by companies who oppose this :
We all have seen sites with Javascript based games that are also cpu intensive but we don't see them getting blocked by Anti-viruses, Adblockers, Internet service providers etc.

Ads, popups get allowed by them all but mining gets blocked.
